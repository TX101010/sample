#Distributed Computing


##Sharing the Workload

<div style="color: red">TK ... 
describe the process of distributing the workload for a large processing task or multiple processors; identify several popular distributed computing projects (SETI@home, protein folding with Folding@home using PS3s, etc.)
</div>


##Parallel Processing

<div style="color: red">TK ... 
compare/contrast the differences between single-threaded and multi-threaded processing; give examples of common problems that can benefit from multiple, parallel processing
</div>


##SETI@Home

<div style="color: red">TK ... 
describe the goals and procedures of UC Berkeley's SETI@Home project; one of the first popular distributed computing projects<br>
<br>
(note: use this section as a model for what students should produce in the following assignment)
</div>


##Assignment

**"What would you do if you could harness the power of a very large array of computers?"**

<div style="color: red">TK ... 
challenge students to collaboratively design a distributed computing project; students should clearly define the goals of the project and the expected outcome; they should describe the type/source of data to be used and give some indication of the types of calculations that might be performed.<br>
<br>
(note: the last part of the assignment &mdash; describing the calculations &mdash; might serve as a good lead in for the discussion of algorithms in the next unit) 
</div>
