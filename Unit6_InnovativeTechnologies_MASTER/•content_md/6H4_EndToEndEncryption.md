##End-to-End Encryption

In the previous chat program example, the private communications between two users actually passes through a third party (i.e., the server), raising potential security concerns. But this issue is not limited to chat programs. In fact, _all_ communications across the network involve at least some handling of the transmitted data by one or more intermediate parties (e.g., routers, gateways, ISP's, etc.) that are neither the sender (i.e., the client) or the intended recipient (i.e., the server). 

In situations where security is a concern, data sent across the network can be encrypted by the client prior to transmission and then decrypted by the server upon receipt.
