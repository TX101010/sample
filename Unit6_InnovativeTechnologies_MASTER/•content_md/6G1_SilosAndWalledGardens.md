#Silos and Walled Gardens


##Barriers to Data Access

<div style="color: red">TK ... 
discuss the reasons why data is sometimes protected and access limited between components of larger systems and networks
</div>


Any fence, wall, or other barrier serves as a point of separation keeping apart ...

... simultaneously serves to protect and the limit.  limits each side from accessing the other (restriction), but also limits each side from disrupting the other (protection)
... can be for protection of one side from the other... or to isolate and restrict

whether one sees barriers as a positive or a negative usually depends on which side of the barrier you are on.




##Data Silos

<div style="color: red">TK ... 
discuss the reasons for isolating data within a larger system; relate to concepts of abstraction and preserving the integrity of the data; discuss the potential downsides (duplication of data/effort, inaccessible data, missed connections) 
</div>


_Information silo occurs whenever a data system is incompatible or not integrated with other data systems._

_repository of fixed data that remains under the control of one department and is isolated from the rest of the organization_

_each organizational unit has different goals, priorities and responsibilities_

_generally viewed as a hindrance to effective business operations and organizations are increasingly trying to break down silos that are a barrier to collaboration, accessibility and efficiency_

_faced increasing criticism not only because they impede productivity but also because solos negatively impact data integrity_

_contents are likely to differ, creating confusion as to which repository represents the most up-to-date version_

_can be challenging to integrate data from systems that were not originally intended to work together_

_information silos are considered to be a cultural problem caused by knowledge workers who don't want to share information, while data silos are the result of technology that hinders collaboration._

_In healthcare, for example, clinical, financial and operational data may be stored and managed by different business divisions in different buildings, each using different software and management tools. Because disparate data systems may have unique validation rules, formats and key identifiers, it can be very difficult for groups to exchange information even when they know that sharing information and providing all interested parties with the same comprehensive view of patient data will result in better care_




##Walled Gardens

<div style="color: red">TK ... 
discuss how closed platforms create restrictions for consumers by limiting their access to wider-reaching data and services; compare contrast the advantages of closed platforms vs. open platforms and debate the merits of each
</div>



_telecommunications, the services and applications accessible on a cell phone on any given wireless were formerly tightly controlled by the mobile operators. The operators limited the applications and developers that were available_

_Similar to a real walled garden, a user in a walled garden is unable to escape this area unless it is through the designated entry/exit points or the walls are removed_

_a software system where the carrier or service provider has control over applications, content, and media, and restricts convenient access to non-approved applications or content._

_in contrast to an open platform, where consumers have unrestricted access to applications, content, and much more_

_Aspects[edit]
An 2008 paper from the Harvard Business School differentiated a platform's openness/closedness by four aspects and gave example platforms.
[hide]Aspect of closedness/openness of a platform[4]	Linux	Windows	Macintosh	iOS
Demand-Side Use (End-user)	open	open	open	open
Supply-Side User (Application developer)	open	open	open	closed
Platform Provider (Hardware/OS Bundle)	open	open	closed	closed
Platform Sponsor (Design & IP Rights Owner)	open	closed	closed	closed_

_limited set of technology or media information provided to users with the intention of creating a monopoly or secure information system_

_The main purpose of creating a walled garden is to shield users from certain kinds of information_

_Schools and colleges extensively use the walled garden method to prevent students from accessing inappropriate content on the Web._

_unpopular with many users because the content offered is limited and is only a part of what the Internet has to offer._

_Different names such as “walled prison” and “walled desert” have been suggested by some users who believe they better reflect and define the confinement of a walled garden_
