#Net Neutrality


##"A Series of Tubes"

<div class="cBox quote">
"The Internet is not something that you just dump something on. It's not a big truck. It is a series of tubes." &mdash; Sen. Ted Stevens

<div style="background:yellow">
And with those unfortunate words from the floor of the Senate on June 28, 2006, ... most Americans became aware of the Net Neutrality debate.

If you have heard of the Net Neutrality debate, you likely already have an opinion about the matter. But is it an informed opinion? ... very complex issue... there are strong and reasonable arguments to be made for each side... ...very volitile issue w/ sensationalized arguments that are designed to rile people up ... people jumping to quick opinions

##Common Carrier

...provider of "telecommunications service" vs. "information service"

Legal scholar Tim Wu, who helped define and popularize the term, 


"...we cannot take for granted. We cannot allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas." ([Obama, 11/10/2014](https://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality))

"...ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online." ([Obama, 11/10/2014](https://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality))
	+ no blocking
	+ no throttling
	+ increased transparency
	+ no paid prioritization

"...For almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business. That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one, and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider. It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information — whether a phone call, or a packet of data." ([Obama, 11/10/2014](https://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality))

"The FCC was chartered to promote competition, innovation, and investment in our networks." ([Obama, 11/10/2014](https://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality))



"...Profits and corporate disfavor of controversial viewpoints or competing services could change both what you can see on the Internet and the quality of your connection." ([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/feature/what-net-neutrality))


"...When we send or receive data over the Internet, we expect those companies to transfer that data from one end of the network to the other. Period. We don't expect them to analyze or manipulate it." ([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/feature/what-net-neutrality))

"...Imagine if the phone company could mess with your calls every time you tried to order pizza from Domino's, because Pizza Hut is paying them to route their calls first. ... The phone company isn't allowed to do that, and, for a while, the FCC said broadband providers couldn't either." ([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/feature/what-net-neutrality))

"...Right now, market competition just isn't enough to stop them from blocking services or charging more for a fast lane." ([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/feature/what-net-neutrality))

"...Common carriage prohibits the owner of a network, that holds itself out to all-comers, from discriminating against information by halting, slowing, or otherwise tampering with the transfer of any data (except for legitimate network management purposes such as easing congestion or blocking spam)." ([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/feature/what-net-neutrality))

"...Common carriage is not a new concept – these rules have a centuries-old history. They have long been applied to facilities central to the public life and economy of our nation, including canal systems, railroads, public highways, and telegraph and telephone networks. In fact, common carrier rules have already been written into the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by Congress; they just need to be applied to broadband Internet communications by the FCC." ([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/feature/what-net-neutrality))


"...all the FCC has to do is reclassify Internet carriage as a "telecommunications service," which would automatically subject online communications to common carrier protections." ([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/feature/what-net-neutrality))


"...Net neutrality, or open Internet, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should give consumers access to all legal content and applications on an equal basis, without favoring some sources or blocking others. It prohibits ISPs from charging content providers for speedier delivery of their content on "fast lanes" and deliberately slowing the content from content providers that may compete with ISPs." ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/24/net-neutrality-what-is-it-guide/23237737/))

"Q: The Internet will be treated like a public utility. Why?

A: So the FCC has the authority to regulate it. Internet providers will be reclassified as "common carriers," private companies that sell their services to all consumers without discrimination, similar to the way consumers got landline telephone service." ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/24/net-neutrality-what-is-it-guide/23237737/))


"..."The network was stupid; it processed packets blindly," he said. "It could no more decide what packets were 'competitors' than the post office can determine which letters criticize it." (Lawrence Lessig, via [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/the-best-writing-on-net-neutrality/361237/))


"If it is so obvious, though, that net neutrality is a good thing, then why has it remained a contested idea? There are complications." ([The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/the-best-writing-on-net-neutrality/361237/))





##The Case _AGAINST_ Net Neutrality

<div style="color: red">TK ... 
outline the arguments for why net neutrality is an dangerous thing to support; discuss its harmful effects to all parties (consumers, media producers, network providers, etc.)

</div>

"...More than two-dozen broadband companies, including AT&T, Comcast, Cox and Verizon, [voiced concerns](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/03/fcc-net-neutrality-react/22807561/) that the new rules are too heavy-handed and could stifle investment and innovation." ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/24/net-neutrality-what-is-it-guide/23237737/))


"...Internet service providers such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon argue that the FCC's planned regulation could hamper their businesses and make investment less practical.​" ([USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/03/fcc-net-neutrality-react/22807561/))


"...The early Internet was dominated by applications such as email and Web browsing, in which delays of half a second were virtually unnoticeable. These are being replaced by newer applications, such as Internet telephony and streaming video, in which such delays can be catastrophic. One obvious solution would be to give a higher priority to traffic associated with time-sensitive applications. Unfortunately, this is precisely the type of discrimination between applications that network neutrality would condemn." ([Federal Communications Law
Journal, Christopher Yoo](http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1485&context=fclj))






##Internet "Fast Lanes"

"This week, news broke that the Federal Communications Commission is considering new rules for how the Internet works.

In short: the FCC would allow network owners (your Verizons, Comcasts, etc.) to create Internet "fast lanes" for companies (Disney, The Atlantic) that pay them more. For Internet activists, this directly violated the principle of net neutrality, which has been a hot-button issue in Silicon Valley for a long time." ([The Atlantic, 4/25/2015](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/the-best-writing-on-net-neutrality/361237/))
